🚀 ETHWalletChecker 💼
Welcome to the ETHWalletChecker! This isn't just any checker - it's a high-speed, high-performance Ethereum wallet balance checker. It's like having a personal assistant for your Ethereum wallets, but without the coffee runs.

🛠 Tech Stack
Java: The backbone of our checker, providing the structure and logic.
Web3j: Our connection to the Ethereum network.
OkHttp3: The messenger that communicates with the APIs.
🌐 Project Overview
ETHWalletChecker is like a detective for your Ethereum wallets. It checks if there's any balance in the 24 key seed provided by a user. It uses different APIs to check the data on the mainnet. The program generates all possible permutations of the seed phrase and checks the balance of each generated wallet asynchronously.

📝 Usage
When you run the program, it will generate all possible permutations of the seed phrase and check the balance of each generated wallet asynchronously. The program outputs the seed phrases with positive balances to a file called "positive_balance.txt" and the seed phrases with zero balances to a file called "zero_balance.txt".
